    "# Refining Fandango Constraints using Avicenna\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous exploration, we saw how **FandangoLearn** could derive constraints that separate failing inputs from passing inputs for a particular program behavior (in this case, a simple calculator-like subject using functions like `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`). However, what we learned was only a first draft. The initial constraints are often too crude, missing nuances that accurately capture the essence of failing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need refinement?** Imagine you’re trying to understand why certain inputs cause failures. You start with a set of initial inputs, such as sqrt(-900) or sqrt(-10). However, in the previous chapter, we have shown that based on a set of initial inputs, we are not able to learn perfect constraints. The constraint `str(<function>) == 'sqrt' and int(<number>) <= -10` fails to capture inputs like `sqt(-4)`. Thus, we need to refine them!\n",
    "\n",
    "A refinement loop allows us to escape these early approximations. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Learning:** We give **FandangoLearn** a set of known inputs, both failing and passing.\n",
    "2. **Initial Constraints:** FandangoLearn tries to find patterns that distinguish these failing inputs from passing ones. Based on a limited input set, it might find something too restrictive, like a rule that only matches failures when `int(<number>) <= -10`.\n",
    "3. **Challenge the Constraints:** We generate new inputs that are not yet distinguished by these constraints. This puts pressure on the current constraints to “fail,” exposing their weaknesses. For instance, if we test `sqrt(-6)`, we see it fails too, even though the constraint said `<= -10`.\n",
    "4. **Refine:** Incorporate these new, challenging inputs back into the learning process, allowing **FandangoLearn** to home in on more accurate constraints. With enough rounds, we transition from rough guesses to finer, more representative constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the refinement loop is a conversation between the learner and the inputs: the constraints try to explain failures, while new inputs (often automatically generated) poke holes in that explanation. Each round makes the constraints more accurate, relevant, and minimal."
